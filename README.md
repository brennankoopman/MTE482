#Joint Range of Motion Device Using IMU Nodes

The goal of this project is to properly apply filtering and deadreckoning techniques to a set of customly designed arduino based IMU nodes. These nodes will communicate their data to a central hub via bluetooth, where the ultimate goal is to be able to use this data in a useful way. The current idea is to use this system within the area of physiotherapy, where the data from the nodes will be able to quantify the flexibility, range of motion, and improvement over time for a practisioner's patients in a simple and non-obstructive fashion.
